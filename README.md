# Hugo Example Starter for GitHub Pages

This repository provides a simple starter template for creating a website using Hugo and hosting it on GitHub Pages. Follow the instructions below to set up the project.

## Installation Process

1. Open your terminal.
1b. You may need to install the XCode Command Line Tools:
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mal-de/hugo-example-starter-github-pages.git
   ```
3. Change directory to the cloned repo:
   ```bash
   cd hugo-example-starter-github-pages
   ```
4. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

It could be that after installing Homebrew, brew is not found in the $PATH variable. The script will stop, since it won't find the brew command. Add brew to the $PATH variable and restart the ./setup.sh. Usually the post-installation process of Homebrew will tell you the exact commands, you need to use in the part called Next Steps.

For example:
- Run these two commands in your terminal to add Homebrew to your PATH:
    (echo; echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"') >> /Users/maliadessu/.zprofile
    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

## File Structure

### Content
- In the `content` folder, you'll find the `_index.md` file. Edit this file to customize the main content of your site.

### Layouts
- The `layouts` folder contains HTML files that structure the entire website. Only edit these if you are familiar with Hugo templating.

### Static
- In the `static` folder:
  - `assets`: Contains the CSS files, primarily `split.css` for styling. Edit this file if you want to customize the styles.
  - `images` and `videos`: Save the images and videos you want to use on the website.
  - `favicon.ico`: This is the favicon for your site. Replace it with another icon if needed. A favicon is a small icon associated with a website, typically displayed in the browser's address bar or tabs, serving as a visual identifier for the site.

### Public
- The `public` folder contains the generated build files. Developers typically don't need to touch this folder as it's automatically generated.

### Config.toml
- Edit the `config.toml` file. Pay attention to lines under "[params]". Lines starting with # are comments. Customize these settings according to your preferences.

## Getting Started Developing Locally

1. Edit the content in `_index.md`.
2. Add images and videos to `static/images` and `static/videos`.
3. Replace the `favicon.ico` with your desired icon.
4. Edit configuration settings in `config.toml`, especially those under "[params]".
5. Customize styles in `static/assets/split.css` if needed.
6. Customize structure in `layouts` if needed.

Now, your Hugo website is ready for customization and can be deployed on GitHub Pages! To preview your site, run `hugo server -D` in the terminal and visit the provided local address.
